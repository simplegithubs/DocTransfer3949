# Clerk Authentication Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

Before running your application with Clerk authentication, you need to:

1. **Create a Clerk Account**
   - Go to [https://clerk.com](https://clerk.com)
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Create a new application

2. **Get Your Clerk Keys**
   - In your Clerk dashboard, navigate to API Keys
   - Copy your **Publishable Key** (starts with `pk_test_` or `pk_live_`)

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (if not already done)
   - Add your Clerk Publishable Key:
     ```
     VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_c2VsZWN0LWNpY2FkYS0zMC5jbGVyay5hY2NvdW50cy5kZXYk
     ```

4. **Apply Database Migration**
   - Run the `add_clerk_auth.sql` script in your Supabase database
   - This adds user profiles and multi-user support

## Running the Application

npm run dev
```
